              Starlings are small to medium-sized passerine birds in the family
              Sturnidae. The name "Sturnidae" comes from the Latin word for
              starling, sturnus. Many Asian species, particularly the larger
              ones, are called mynas, and many African species are known as
              glossy starlings because of their iridescent plumage. Starlings
              are native to Europe, Asia and Africa, as well as northern
              Australia and the islands of the tropical Pacific. Several
              European and Asian species have been introduced to these areas as
              well as North America, Hawaii and New Zealand, where they
              generally compete for habitats with native birds and are
              considered to be invasive species. The starling species familiar
              to most people in Europe and North America is the common starling,
              and throughout much of Asia and the Pacific, the common myna is
              indeed common. Starlings have strong feet, their flight is strong
              and direct, and they are very gregarious. Their preferred habitat
              is fairly open country, and they eat insects and fruit. Several
              species live around human habitation and are effectively
              omnivores. Many species search for prey such as grubs by
              "open-bill probing", that is, forcefully opening the bill after
              inserting it into a crevice, thus expanding the hole and exposing
              the prey; this behaviour is referred to by the German verb zirkeln
              (pronounced [ˈtsɪʁkl̩n]).[1] Plumage of many species is typically
              dark with a metallic sheen. Most species nest in holes and lay
              blue or white eggs. Starlings have diverse and complex
              vocalizations and have been known to embed sounds from their
              surroundings into their own calls, including car alarms and human
              speech patterns. The birds can recognize particular individuals by
              their calls and are the subject of research into the evolution of
              human language.[2]
