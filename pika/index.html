          A pika (/ˈpaɪkə/ PY-kə; archaically spelled pica) is a small,
          mountain-dwelling mammal found in Asia and North America. With short
          limbs, very round body, an even coat of fur, and no external tail,
          they resemble their close relative, the rabbit, but with short,
          rounded ears.[3] The large-eared pika of the Himalayas and nearby
          mountains is found at heights of more than 6,000 m (20,000 ft), among
          the highest of any mammal. Pikas prefer rocky slopes and graze on a
          range of plants, mostly grasses, flowers and young stems. In the
          autumn they pull hay, soft twigs and other stores of food into their
          burrows to eat during the long, cold winter.[4] The pika is also known
          as the whistling hare because of its high-pitched alarm call when
          diving into its burrow. The name ‘pika’ appears to be derived from the
          Tungus piika,[5] and the scientific name Ochotona is from the
          Mongolian word ogutun-a, оготно, which means pika.[6] It is used for
          any member of the Ochotonidae,[7] a family within the order of
          lagomorphs which also includes the Leporidae (rabbits and hares). Only
          one genus, Ochotona,[7] is extant within the family, covering 37
          species, though many fossil genera are known. Another species, the
          Sardinian pika, belonging to the separate genus Prolagus, has become
          extinct within the last 2000 years owing to human activity. The two
          species found in North America are the American pika, found primarily
          in the mountains of the western United States and far southwestern
          Canada, and the collared pika of northern British Columbia, the Yukon,
          western Northwest Territories and Alaska.
