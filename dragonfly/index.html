            A dragonfly is a flying insect belonging to the order Odonata,
            infraorder Anisoptera (from Greek ἄνισος anisos, "unequal" and
            πτερόν pteron, "wing", because the hindwing is broader than the
            forewing). Adult dragonflies are characterized by a pair of large,
            multifaceted compound eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings,
            sometimes with coloured patches, and an elongated body. Dragonflies
            can be mistaken for the closely related damselflies, which make up
            the other odonatan infraorder (Zygoptera) and are similar in body
            plan though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most
            dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies
            hold their wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen.
            Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker,
            fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or
            metallic colours produced by structural colouration, making them
            conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly's compound eyes have
            nearly 24,000 ommatidia each. Fossils of very large dragonfly-like
            insects, sometimes called griffinflies, are found from 325 million
            years ago (Mya) in Upper Carboniferous rocks; these had wingspans up
            to about 750 mm (30 in), but were only distant ancestors, not true
            dragonflies. About 3,000 extant species of true dragonfly are known.
            Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions. Loss of
            wetland habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world.
            Dragonflies are predatory insects, both in their aquatic nymphs
            stage (also known as naiads) and as adults. In some species, the
            nymphal stage lasts for up to five years, and the adult stage may be
            as long as ten weeks, but most species have an adult lifespan in the
            order of five weeks or less, and some survive for only a few
            days.[2] They are fast, agile fliers capable of highly accurate
            aerial ambush, sometimes migrating across oceans, and often live
            near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction
            involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm
            competition. During mating, the male grasps the female at the back
            of the head, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick
            up sperm from the male's secondary genitalia at the front of his
            abdomen, forming the "heart" or "wheel" posture. Dragonflies are
            represented in human culture on artefacts such as pottery, rock
            paintings, statues and Art Nouveau jewellery. They are used in
            traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in
            Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in
            Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright
            colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of Lord Tennyson
            and the prose of H. E. Bates.
